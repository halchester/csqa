## CSQA

##### Forum for devs and anyone who's starting their cs or coding journey

So what is CSQA? CSQA is a Progressive Web App aimed for those who wanna ask silly questions but afraid to get downvoted on stackoverflow, on CSQA, you can ask any questions related to dev, life, crypto, literally everything! (But your question can still get downvoted! ü§ê)

### Tech stack

I'm a big fan of react and I mainly used React and Node for both frontend and backend. (I was gonna use Next fullstack but the code refactoring sucks with it so changed back to MERN ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

- React (Next)
- Node 
- Express
- Typescript‚ù§Ô∏è (ofc who doesn't love TS?)
- Chakra UI (elegent CSS framework)
- Formik 
- Vercel 
- mongodb (the only db I know)

You can checkout the rest in [package.json](./client/package.json).

### Experience on this app

I actually made this web app so that I can learn about database design and multi-user workflow. The app is not the best one out there but it does its job (clearly duh). I learnt a lot about how to design a effective database schema and relational references. It's quite interesting how the actual stackoverflow platform works with all downvotes, upvotes, comment threads and many more. (other features are yet to come to this app).
